This is a simple E-Commerce application built using Vue.js version 2. It accesses the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch product data and display it in a user-friendly manner. User can view the products by clicking the "Next Product" button, and the app will fetch the products from the API with an incrementing index number. The app checks the product's category and displays it accordingly on one of the three pages: men's section, women's section, or unavailable product.
